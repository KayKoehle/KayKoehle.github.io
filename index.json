Today, many consumers own head-mounted displays (HMDs), allowing them to participate in scientific studies from their homes using their own equipment. Researchers can benefit from this approach by being able to recruit study populations normally out of their reach, and to conduct research at times when it is difficult to get people into the lab (cf. the COVID pandemic). In an initial online survey (N = 227), we assessed HMD owners’ demographics, their VR setups and their attitudes toward remote participation. We then identified different approaches to running remote studies and conducted two case studies for an in-depth understanding. We synthesize our findings into a framework for remote VR studies, discuss strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches, and derive best practices. Our work is valuable for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers conducting VR studies outside labs.","tags":["Virtual reality"],"title":"Remote VR Studies: A Framework for Running Virtual Reality Studies Remotely Via Participant-Owned HMDs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kay Köhle","Matthias Hoppe","Albrecht Schmidt \u0026 Ville Mäkelä"],"categories":["Virtual reality","Games","Diegetic interfaces","First-person shooters","Game design"],"content":"","date":1629936e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629936e3,"objectID":"69425fb10d4db090cfbd46854715582c","permalink":"https://kaykoehle.github.io/publication/conference-paper/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"The player’s health is one of the most pervasive components in computer games. However, in virtual reality games, it is unclear how different representations of player health function compared to traditional flat-screen games. Because the viewpoint changes based on the player’s head movement, non-diegetic UI elements may not be ideal. Also, the sense of embodiment in VR provides opportunities to experiment with diegetic ways of communicating the player’s health. To investigate different implementations of player health in VR games, we developed three health interfaces and evaluated them in a shooter game. The health interfaces included: 1) A non-diegetic health bar, visible on the screen at all times, 2) A diegetic health value on a virtual wristwatch, and 3) A diegetic physical interface, where lost health results in trembling and slower movement. 37 participants played the game using all three health interfaces and provided feedback. We found that all three interfaces had their own strengths. The non-diegetic health bar was seen as suitable for multi-player games, while the wristwatch was seen as suitable for single-player, story-driven games. The physical interface was liked for its impact on gameplay, and was also seen as suitable for story-driven games.","tags":["Virtual reality"],"title":"Diegetic and Non-diegetic Health Interfaces in VR Shooter Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://kaykoehle.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"A flutter app for my party card game.","tags":["Hobby Projects"],"title":"Points Don't Matter","type":"project"}]
