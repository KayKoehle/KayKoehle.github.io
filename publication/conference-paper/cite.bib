  abstract="The player's health is one of the most pervasive components in computer games. However, in virtual reality games, it is unclear how different representations of player health function compared to traditional flat-screen games. Because the viewpoint changes based on the player's head movement, non-diegetic UI elements may not be ideal. Also, the sense of embodiment in VR provides opportunities to experiment with diegetic ways of communicating the player's health. To investigate different implementations of player health in VR games, we developed three health interfaces and evaluated them in a shooter game. The health interfaces included: 1) A non-diegetic health bar, visible on the screen at all times, 2) A diegetic health value on a virtual wristwatch, and 3) A diegetic physical interface, where lost health results in trembling and slower movement. 37 participants played the game using all three health interfaces and provided feedback. We found that all three interfaces had their own strengths. The non-diegetic health bar was seen as suitable for multi-player games, while the wristwatch was seen as suitable for single-player, story-driven games. The physical interface was liked for its impact on gameplay, and was also seen as suitable for story-driven games.",
