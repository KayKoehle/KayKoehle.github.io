abstract: We investigate opportunities and challenges of running virtual reality
  (VR) studies remotely. Today, many consumers own head-mounted displays (HMDs),
  allowing them to participate in scientific studies from their homes using
  their own equipment. Researchers can benefit from this approach by being able
  to recruit study populations normally out of their reach, and to conduct
  research at times when it is difficult to get people into the lab (cf. the
  COVID pandemic). In an initial online survey (N = 227), we assessed HMD
  owners’ demographics, their VR setups and their attitudes toward remote
  participation. We then identified different approaches to running remote
  studies and conducted two case studies for an in-depth understanding. We
  synthesize our findings into a framework for remote VR studies, discuss
  strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches, and derive best
  practices. Our work is valuable for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
  researchers conducting VR studies outside labs.
