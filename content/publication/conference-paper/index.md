abstract: "The player’s health is one of the most pervasive components in
  computer games. However, in virtual reality games, it is unclear how different
  representations of player health function compared to traditional flat-screen
  games. Because the viewpoint changes based on the player’s head movement,
  non-diegetic UI elements may not be ideal. Also, the sense of embodiment in VR
  provides opportunities to experiment with diegetic ways of communicating the
  player’s health. To investigate different implementations of player health in
  VR games, we developed three health interfaces and evaluated them in a shooter
  game. The health interfaces included: 1) A non-diegetic health bar, visible on
  the screen at all times, 2) A diegetic health value on a virtual wristwatch,
  and 3) A diegetic physical interface, where lost health results in trembling
  and slower movement. 37 participants played the game using all three health
  interfaces and provided feedback. We found that all three interfaces had their
  own strengths. The non-diegetic health bar was seen as suitable for
  multi-player games, while the wristwatch was seen as suitable for
  single-player, story-driven games. The physical interface was liked for its
  impact on gameplay, and was also seen as suitable for story-driven games."
